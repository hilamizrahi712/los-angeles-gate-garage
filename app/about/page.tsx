                  This business was built on a simple idea: be the kind of company you&apos;d
                  actually want to show up when something breaks at your home. Not a voice
                  mail. Not a three-day wait. Someone who picks up, comes out, and fixes it
                  right the first time.
                </p>
                <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.25rem" }}>
                  We started with garage doors — but customers kept asking about their gates.
                  So we went deep on gates. Most companies treat gate repair as a side service.
                  For us, it&apos;s where we&apos;ve built our sharpest expertise, because that&apos;s where
                  homeowners need the most help.

                <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.25rem" }}>
                  When someone calls us, they&apos;re rarely calm. Their car is stuck, they&apos;re
                  already late, or they&apos;re worried about security overnight. We remember that
                  behind every service call is a real person in a stressful moment — and our
                  job is to resolve that moment quickly and honestly.

                  us — and then told a neighbor.

              have a technician to you within hours — most days, the same morning.
